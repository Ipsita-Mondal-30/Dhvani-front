## 🔧 How to Test Multilingual Speech

### Method 1: Use the Home Screen
1. Go to Home tab
2. Use the language switcher to change to Hindi or Bengali
3. Tap "Replay Welcome" button
4. Should hear speech in the selected language

### Method 2: Check Console Logs
1. Open your development console
2. Change language and trigger speech
3. Look for these logs:
   ```
   🎤 [HomeScreen] Speaking in language: hi
   🎤 [HomeScreen] Message: [translated message]
   ✅ [HomeScreen] Speech completed
   ```

### Method 3: Use the Test Component
1. Temporarily add `<SpeechTest />` to any screen
2. Use the test buttons to verify each language
3. Check console for detailed error messages

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Speech Issues

### If Speech Still Doesn't Work in Multiple Languages:

1. **Check Device Language Support**:
   - iOS: Go to Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Voices
   - Android: Go to Settings > Language & Input > Text-to-Speech

2. **Check Console Logs**:
   - Look for error messages in the development console
   - Check if the language codes are being passed correctly

3. **Test with Simple Language Codes**:
   - The app now uses `en`, `hi`, `bn` instead of region-specific codes
   - This should work on more devices

4. **Fallback Behavior**:
   - If Hindi/Bengali fails, it should automatically fall back to English
   - Check console for "Falling back to English" message

- ✅ Shows storage statistics
- ✅ Allows PDF management (select/delete)

### Home Page:

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the Profile Tab**: Verify the 👤 icon is now visible
2. **Test PDF History**: Check that PDF history appears in Profile
3. **Test Speech**: Try changing languages and using speech features
4. **Check Console**: Look for speech-related logs to debug any issues
5. **Report Results**: Let me know which parts are working and which need more fixes

The app should now be much cleaner with better organization and more robust multilingual speech support!
